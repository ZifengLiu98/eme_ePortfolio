					<h2>Image Editing</h2>
					<p>A book cover for Free as the Clouds by Nan Huai-Chin was created using bitmap images via Gimp. An original logo named "Hero in the Cloud" was created to plays on the metaphor of cloud computing and the freedom of exploration, representing an individual who navigates the boundless digital landscape like a superhero.</p>

					<h2>Digital Animation</h2>
					<p>For this animation, I designed each scene in PowerPoint using its built-in 3D models for the Earth and Moon, positioning them to represent the orbital layout. 
						I applied a rotation animation to the Moon and synchronized it with a semi-transparent blue ellipse around the Earth, which simulates the tidal effect.</p>
