                <p><font size = "4">The first step in creating this tutorial video was to clearly define the topic and goals. I decided to demonstrate how to use Overleaf, an online LaTeX editor,
					 to create and edit academic documents efficiently. To ensure the video would be engaging and easy to follow, I planned the content thoroughly in advance. 
					 This included outlining the key steps, such as selecting a template, editing the code, and using the live compilation feature. 
					 I also decided to highlight additional features like document sharing and reference management to provide viewers with a comprehensive understanding of Overleaf.</font><br> </p>

					 <p><font size = "4">For recording, I used Taprecord, a reliable screen recording software. I began by opening Overleaf and showcasing how to start a new project by selecting a template. 
						During the recording, I carefully demonstrated each step, from modifying the code to observing the real-time updates in the document preview. 
						I kept my movements deliberate and avoided unnecessary distractions on the screen to ensure clarity. I also included pauses and zoomed in on critical sections to 
						make the steps easier to follow for viewers..</font><br> </p>

						<p><font size = "4">Once the recording was complete, I imported the footage into Veed for editing and voiceover work. In Veed, I recorded voiceovers to explain each step in detail, 
							ensuring that the narration aligned seamlessly with the on-screen actions. I made several adjustments to the timeline to synchronize the audio with the video. 
							To enhance the tutorial's appeal, I added transitions, subtitles, and some light background music. These elements helped maintain the video’s flow and kept it visually engaging. 
							I also trimmed out any unnecessary segments, such as idle moments or mistakes, to keep the content concise and focused..</font><br> </p>

       <font size = "4">I enjoyed using Camtasia to create my Screencast and think that it is a great tool. Using Camtasia, I recorded my screen and voiceover and added animations to the beginning and end of my video. I also added text as an introduction and conclusion, using blue and orange to match some of the colors in my screen recording. I decided to change the color and add a shadow to my cursor to make it easier to follow during the screen recording. Initially, I had my cursor highlighted but found that the highlight was covering some of my text, so I decided to change it. Finally, I added yellow arrows to signal key areas on the screen as I was demonstrating. I tried a few different colors for the cursor and arrows but decided to keep yellow because I found it more eye-catching.  </font>
