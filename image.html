                 <h2 style="text-align: center;">Part 1 Digital Book Cover</h2>
                <center><img src=Figs/ass_1.png alt ="cover" width="800" height="400"></img></center><br><br><br>              
                <p><font size = "4">The inspiration for my cover design comes from the book Free as the Clouds by Nan Huai-Chin, which explores the themes of freedom in life and the serenity of the soul through the lens of traditional Chinese culture and philosophy. The book reflects a deep understanding of how, like clouds in the sky, life is ever-changing and full of potential for peace and harmony.

                    To embody these ideas visually, I chose a serene cloudscape as the background, symbolizing the vastness and freedom that the clouds represent. The flowing clouds evoke a sense of calm and tranquility, mirroring the book's exploration of inner peace. To add depth, I layered soft, wave-like shapes at the bottom of the image, representing the flow of life and the gentle, natural movement that echoes the cloud’s freedom. Additionally, I overlaid another layer with a blend of colored lights, taken from a screenshot of my current desktop image on macOS. I adjusted the transparency of this layer to subtly enhance the composition without overwhelming the design.
                    
                    For the title, "Free as the Clouds," I selected a graceful, flowing font in red, a color often associated with vitality and strength in Chinese culture. The shadow effect adds dimension to the text, while the subtitle, “True freedom lies in the tranquility of the soul,” is placed in a subtle gray to highlight its contemplative message. The placement of the text over the soft, expansive clouds reinforces the idea of soaring freely, both in body and spirit.</font> </p> <br><br><br>
                    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Part 2 Logo Design</h2>
                <center><img src=Figs/ass_1_2.png alt ="cover" width="400" height="300"></img></center><br><br><br>
                    
            <p><font size = "4">The inspiration behind this logo comes from the idea of blending a modern, digital world with a sense of adventure and heroism. The title "Hero in the Cloud" plays on the metaphor of cloud computing and the freedom of exploration, representing an individual who navigates the boundless digital landscape like a superhero. I wanted the design to evoke the feeling of empowerment, where technology becomes a tool for individuals to unlock their full potential—flying high like a hero above the clouds. The soft cloud background reinforces the idea of navigating a limitless virtual space, with the character symbolizing someone who masters the complexities of the cloud, whether in programming, technology, or a learning environment. The main content of the logo, including the cloud and the hero in purple, are sourced from PowerPoint 3D models. The elliptical shape symbolizes the universe, representing infinity and endless possibilities. It suggests the idea of continuous exploration and growth, much like the never-ending opportunities in the digital world.</p>
