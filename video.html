                <p><font size = "4">In this video, I introduced a teachable agent by showcasing its main interface and features. First, I recorded a demonstration of the teachable agent in action, capturing a walkthrough of its key functionalities. To make the interaction clear, I set up the recording to show the mouse clicks in real-time, which helps illustrate exactly how users can navigate and interact with the agent. More information about this teachable agent can be found onlineLinks to an external site.. 

					After recording, I generated captions based on the video content to enhance accessibility and ensure all viewers could follow along easily. I then added these captions directly to the video, positioning them accurately to sync with the visuals.
					
					For the audio component, I used a text-to-speech tool to produce corresponding audio that matched each segment of the video, giving it a cohesive narrative flow. I carefully adjusted the timing of the audio to align with the visuals and captions, creating a clear, guided experience for viewers. I also added a lively background music and adjusted its volume to make it fit into the video.</font>  <br></p>
