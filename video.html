I have been to many of the places featured in my video and am looking forward to visiting the others in the future.

	<p><font size = "4">  The 18 images that I used for this video included a combination of stock images, maps, and photos that I have taken. I found the perfect background music titled “Ebbs and Flows” on Incompetech.com. I selected this background music mainly because it was relaxing and included the sound of waves. For the most part I used the fade in/fade out transition, but I also used the Smooth Blur and Wave transitions for two of my clips. I used a few different panning and zooming movements and chose each one based on the image. I also used several enhancement effects such as contrast and auto levels. I used the Float effect for the font on every image for consistency. For the font, I selected MV Boli, white as the text color, and added a shadow to help the text stand out from the image. I organized my information based on the location of each of the coasts, moving south from the Panhandle. I adjusted my narration several times to match the length and order of each clip.</font>
